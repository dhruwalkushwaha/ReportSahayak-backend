  "summary": "The blood test results show mostly normal values. Liver function tests (ALT) are within the normal range.  Hemoglobin, red blood cell counts, and other related indices are also within the reference intervals. White blood cell counts and differential are within normal limits. Vitamin D levels are borderline low.  The slightly elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) may warrant further investigation.",
