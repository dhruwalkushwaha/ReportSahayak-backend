  "summary": "Your lab results show mostly normal values.  Liver function (ALT) is within the normal range.  Your white blood cell counts are slightly low, but still within the acceptable range. Your red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit are also within the normal range.  However, your Vitamin D level is below the optimal range.  It's recommended to discuss these results with your doctor to interpret them within the context of your overall health and any symptoms you may be experiencing.",
