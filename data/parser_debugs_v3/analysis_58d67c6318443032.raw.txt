  "summary": "Your blood test results show low platelet count (3 thou/mm), low red blood cell count (3 mill/mm), and low total leukocyte count (3 thou/mm).  These values fall significantly below the normal reference ranges, suggesting potential underlying issues that require further investigation by a healthcare professional.  It's crucial to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and management.",

    "Red Blood Cells": [
      {
        "test_name": "RBC Count",
        "value": "3",
        "unit": "mill/mm",
        "status": "Low",
        "analogy": "Imagine your red blood cells as delivery trucks carrying oxygen throughout your body. A low count means fewer trucks are available to deliver oxygen, potentially leading to fatigue and weakness.",
        "explanation": "This result indicates anemia, a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause."

        "status": "Low",
        "analogy": "Platelets are like tiny repair crews in your blood that help stop bleeding. Low platelet count means your body's ability to clot blood is compromised, increasing the risk of bleeding.",
        "explanation": "This indicates thrombocytopenia, a condition where you have a lower than normal number of platelets. This can increase your risk of bleeding and bruising.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause."

        "analogy": "White blood cells are your body's defense system against infections.  A low count suggests a weakened immune system, making you more vulnerable to infections.",
        "explanation": "Leukopenia is a condition characterized by a low white blood cell count.  This can increase your susceptibility to infections.  Further testing is needed to pinpoint the reason."
