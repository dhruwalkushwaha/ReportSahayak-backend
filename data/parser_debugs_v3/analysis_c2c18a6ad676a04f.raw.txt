  "summary": "Vitamin D levels are below the recommended range.  One test shows a level of 75 nmol/L, which is within the lower end of the normal range, while another test shows a level of less than 15 nmol/L, which is significantly below the normal range.  This may indicate a Vitamin D deficiency and warrants further investigation by a healthcare professional.",

      {
        "test_name": "VITAMIN D",
        "value": "75",
        "unit": "nmol/L",
        "ref_interval": "75.00 - 250.00",
        "status": "Low-normal",
        "analogy": "Imagine your bones as a building; Vitamin D is like the cement that holds it together.  While not critically low, this level may indicate a need to strengthen the 'foundation'.",
        "explanation": "This test measures the level of Vitamin D in your blood. A value of 75 nmol/L is at the lower end of the normal range, suggesting that your Vitamin D levels could be improved to optimize bone health and overall well-being."
