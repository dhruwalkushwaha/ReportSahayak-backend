        "status": "Normal",
        "analogy": "Your thyroid is producing the right amount of T4, a key hormone.",
        "explanation": "T4 is a major thyroid hormone responsible for metabolism.  The level is within the healthy reference range."

        "analogy": "Your TSH is slightly elevated, but still within the acceptable range; your doctor may want to monitor this.",
        "explanation": "TSH stimulates thyroid hormone production. While slightly above the ideal range, it's not critically high."
