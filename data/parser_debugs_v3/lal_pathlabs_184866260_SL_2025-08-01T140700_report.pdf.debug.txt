Note  
·
The assay measures both D2 (Ergocalciferol) and D3 (Cholecalciferol) metabolites of vitamin D.
·
25 (OH)D is influenced by sunlight, latitude, skin pigmentation, sunscreen use and hepatic function.
·
Optimal calcium absorption requires vitamin D 25 (OH) levels exceeding 75 nmol/L.
·
It shows seasonal variation, with values being 40-50% lower in winter than in summer. 
·
Levels vary with age and are increased in pregnancy. 
·
A new test Vitamin D, Ultrasensitive by LC-MS/MS is also available
Comments
Vitamin D promotes absorption of calcium and phosphorus and mineralization of bones and teeth. Deficiency 
in children causes Rickets and in adults leads to Osteomalacia.  It can also lead to Hypocalcemia and 
Tetany.  Vitamin D status is best determined  by measurement of 25 hydroxy vitamin D, as it is the major 
circulating form and has longer half life (2-3 weeks) than 1,25 Dihydroxy vitamin D (5-8 hrs).
Decreased Levels
·
Inadequate exposure to sunlight
·
Dietary deficiency
