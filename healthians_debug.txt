Urea, Serum
Serum urea is the normal waste product, which is produced in the liver after breaking down
of proteins and is removed by kidneys. If the kidneys or liver are not functioning well, the
urea levels in blood rise. This test helps measure the urea levels in blood and assess kidney
functioning.
Impact on overall health?
This test assesses your risk of kidney damage, liver damage, circulatory problems or dehydration. You
may also be advised this test to check for renal complications in diabetes.
How to improve health conditions?
If your serum urea levels are high, consult your physician for treatment. If the fluctuations in urea
levels are due to dietary changes or medications, avoid those changes.

Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile and is a breakdown product of normal heme catabolism. Elevated levels are a result of  increased
bilirubin production (e.g hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis),  decreased bilirubin excretion (e.g.; obstruction and hepatitis) and abnormal
bilirubin metabolism (e.g; hereditary and neonatal jaundice) .
Conjugated (direct) bilirubin is elevated in conditions like- Hereditary disorders( Dubin Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome),Hepatocellular
damage(e.g –viral ,toxic ,alcohol ,drugs) ,biliary duct obstruction  (extrahepatic or intrahepatic), Infiltrations ,space occupying lesions(e.g

metastasis, abscess , granuloma , amyloidosis. Increased unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin may be a result of hemolytic or pernicious anemia,
transfusion reaction & a common metabolic condition termed Gilbert syndrome.
AST levels increase in viral hepatitis, blockage of the bile duct ,cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, pancreatitis,
hemochromatosis. AST  levels may also increase after a heart attack or strenuous activity.
ALT is a liver specific enzyme  commonly measured as a part of a diagnostic evaluation of hepatocellular injury, to determine liver health.
Elevated ALP levels are seen in Biliary Obstruction, Osteoblastic Bone Tumors, Osteomalacia, Hepatitis, Hyperparathyroidism, Leukemia,
Lymphoma, Paget’s disease, Rickets, Sarcoidosis etc.
Elevated serum GGT activity can be found in diseases of the liver, Biliary system and pancreas. Obstructive liver disease, high alcohol
consumption and use of enzyme-inducing drugs lead to raised GGT levels .
Serum total protein measures  the total amount of protein in serum. It is largely comprised  of albumin and globulins. Increased levels  may be
due to: Chronic inflammation or infection, including HIV and hepatitis B or C, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's disease. Decreased levels may
be due to: Agammaglobulinemia, Bleeding (hemorrhage), Burns, Glomerulonephritis, Liver disease, Malabsorption, Malnutrition, Nephrotic
Syndrome.
Albumin is the most abundant protein in the serum and is produced in the liver. Low serum albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia) can be caused by:
Liver diseases like liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, burns, hemodilution, increased vascular permeability or
decreased lymphatic clearance, malnutrition and wasting .
Globulins are increased in most liver diseases , in chronic inflammatory diseases and neoplastic diseases

The kidneys play a vital role in the excretion of waste products and toxins such as urea, creatinine and uric acid, regulation of extracellular fluid
volume, serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations, as well as the production of hormones like erythropoietin and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D
and renin. Assessment of renal function is important in the management of patients with kidney disease or pathologies affecting renal function.
Tests of renal function have utility in identifying the presence of renal disease, monitoring the response of kidneys to treatment, and determining
the progression of renal disease.
Urea is synthesized in the liver as the final product of protein and amino acid metabolism. Urea synthesis is therefore dependent on daily protein
intake and endogenous protein metabolism.
Creatinine is a metabolic product of creatine and phosphocreatine, which are both found almost exclusively in muscle.
Uric Acid is the major product of purine catabolism in humans. Uric acid levels are used to monitor the treatment of gout.
Measurement of calcium is used in the diagnosis and treatment of parathyroid disease, a variety of bone diseases, chronic renal disease,

urolithiasis and tetany. Phosphorus levels are increased in acute or chronic renal failure with decreased GFR .
Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water  in and around the cells & the balance of chemicals in the body called acids
and bases.
Chloride  is a negatively charged ion that works with other electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate, to help regulate the amount
of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance.

Dyslipidemia is a disorder of fat or lipoprotein metabolism in the body and includes lipoprotein overproduction or deficiency. 
Dyslipidemias means increase in the level of one or more of the following: Total Cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or triglyceride
concentrations.
Dyslipidemia also includes a decrease in the “good" cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration in the blood.
Cholesterol is a steroid carried in the bloodstream as lipoprotein, necessary for cell membrane functioning and as a precursor to bile acids,
progesterone ,vitamin D ,estrogens ,glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.
HDL is termed “good cholesterol” because its levels are inversely related to the risk of  Coronary heart disease.

LDL cholesterol is termed the “bad cholesterol” and their increased levels are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary
heart disease.
Lipid level assessments must be made following 9 to 12 hours of fasting, otherwise assay results might lead to erroneous interpretation.
Healthians labs report biological reference intervals (normal ranges) in accordance with  the recommendations of The National Cholesterol
Education Program (NCEP) & Adult Treatment Panel IV (ATP IV) guidelines providing the most desirable targets of various circulating lipid
fractions in the blood. NCEP recommends that all adults above 20 years of age must be screened for abnormal lipid levels.

The main indication for testing for glucose in urine is detection of unsuspected diabetes mellitus or follow-up of known diabetic patients. Renal glycosuria accounts
for 5% of cases of glycosuria in general population.
Proteinuria can be seen in nephrotic syndrome, pyelonephritis, heavy metal poisoning, tuberculosis of kidney, interstitial nephritis, cystinosis, Fanconi syndrome ,
rejection of kidney transplant. Hemodynamic proteinuria is transient and can be seen in high fever, hypertension, heavy exercise, congestive cardiac failure,
seizures, and exposure to cold. Post-renal proteinuria is caused by inflammatory or neoplastic conditions in renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, prostate, or urethra.
Ketonuria can be seen in uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis, Glycogen storage disorder, starvation, persistent vomiting in children, weight reduction
program, fever in children, severe thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy and protein calorie malnutrition.
Presence of bilirubin in urine indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (obstructive or hepatocellular jaundice). Bile salts along with bilirubin can be detected in urine in
cases of obstructive jaundice. Normally about 0.5-4 mg of urobilinogen is excreted in urine in 24 hours. Therefore, a small amount of urobilinogen is normally
detectable in urine. Increased urobilinogen in urine can be seen due to hemolysis , megaloblastic anemia and haemorrhage in tissues. Decreased urobilinogen can be
seen in obstructive jaundice, reduction of intestinal bacterial flora, neonates and following antibiotic treatment. The presence of abnormal number of intact red blood
cells in urine is called as hematuria. It implies presence of a bleeding lesion in the urinary tract. Hematuria can be seen in glomerular diseases like Glomerulonephritis,
Berger’s disease, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, non glomerular diseases like Calculus, tumor, infection, tuberculosis, pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis,
polycystic kidney disease, trauma, after strenuous physical exercise, diseases of prostate (benign hyperplasia of prostate, carcinoma of prostate).
Nitrites are not present in normal urine. Ingested nitrites are converted to nitrate and excreted
in urine. If gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E.coli, Salmonella, Proteus, Klebsiella, etc.) are present in urine, they will reduce the nitrates to nitrites through the action of
bacterial enzyme nitrate reductase.  As E. coli is the commonest organism causing urinary tract infection, this test is helpful as a screening test for urinary tract
infection.
Some organisms like Staphylococci or Pseudomonas do not reduce nitrate to nitrite and therefore in such infections nitrite test is negative.
Leucocyte esterase test detects esterase enzyme released in urine from granules of leucocytes. Thus the test is positive in pyuria.

The International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) recommends reporting of absolute counts of various WBC subsets for clinical decision making.
This test has been performed on a fully automated 5 part differential cell counter which counts over 10,000 WBCs to derive differential counts. A complete blood
count is a blood panel that gives information about the cells in a patient's blood, such as the cell count for each cell type and the concentrations of Hemoglobin and
platelets. The cells that circulate in the bloodstream are generally divided into three types: white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets
(thrombocytes). Abnormally high or low counts may be physiological or may indicate disease conditions, and hence need to be interpreted clinically.

The Mentzer index is used to differentiate iron deficiency anaemia beta thalassemia trait. If a CBC indicates microcytic anaemia, these are two of the most likely
causes, making It necessary to distinguish between them.
If the quotient of the mean corpuscular volume divided by the red blood cell count is then 13, thalassemia is more likely. If the result is greater than 13, then iron-
deficiency anaemia is more likely.

Healthians recommends that the following potential sources of variation should be considered while interpreting thyroid hormone results:
1. Thyroid hormones undergo rhythmic variation within the body this is called circadian variation in TSH secretion: Peak levels are seen between
2-4 AM. Minimum levels seen between 6-10 AM. This variation may be as much as 50% thus, influence of sampling time needs to be considered
for clinical interpretation.
2. Circulating forms of T3 and T4 are mostly reversibly bound with Thyroxine binding globulins (TBG), and to a lesser extent with albumin and
Thyroid binding Pre-Albumin. Thus the conditions in which TBG and protein levels alter such as chronic liver disorders, pregnancy, excess of
estrogens, androgens, anabolic steroids and glucocorticoids may cause misleading total T3, total T4 and TSH interpretations.
3. Total T3 and T4 levels are seen to have physiological rise during pregnancy and in patients on steroid treatment.
4. T4 may be normal even in the presence of hyperthyroidism under the following conditions : T3 thyrotoxicosis, Hypoproteinemia related reduced
binding, during intake of certain drugs (eg Phenytoin, Salicylates etc)
5. Neonates and infants have higher levels of T4 due to increased concentration of TBG
6. TSH levels may be normal in central hypothyroidism, recent rapid correction of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, phenytoin therapy
etc.
7. TSH values of <0.03 uIU/mL must be clinically correlated to evaluate the presence of a rare TSH variant in certain individuals which is
undetectable by conventional methods.
8. Presence of Autoimmune disorders may lead to spurious results of thyroid hormones.
9. Various drugs influence the levels of thyroid hormones such as L-Dopa, Lithium, Glucocorticoids, Phenytoin etc.
10. Healthians recommends evaluation of unbound fractions, that is free T3 (fT3) and free T4 (fT4) for clinic-pathologic correlation, as these are
the metabolically active forms.
